# Description

This is a node terminal app that allows the user to easily create a README.md file by answering a series of prompts via inquirer. Once the prompts have been answered, a writeFile function executes and generates a readme based on a standard template, creating a professional readme, including the appropriate license text and badge. This readme has been generated using the program, and is currently being used as a test. It will be further detailed out as the project nears completion. 

# Installation

Clone the repo and open it in your code editor of choice. reference the gitignore file to install the necessary dependencies. Once the installations have been complete, open a terminal and navigate to the working directory. From there, use the node index.js command to initiate the program.

# Usage

Once the program is initiated, follow the prompts in the terminal, adding the appropriate information about your repo. Please note - the README template is a template string, so you should be able to use both single and double quotes safely without risk of interrupting the string. Using triple backticks to create a code block should work as well. Using a signle backtick outside of a code block, on the other hand, could cause an error. Once all prompts ahve been answered, a file named README.md will be generated in the working directory. This is your README.md file! Please note, running the program again will directly overwrite it, so make sure to move the file out if you would like to make several versions.

# Contributing

Fork the repo to your own GitHub profile, create a new branch, and make changes as you wish. Once finished, push the changes up to your branch and create a new pull request so they can be reviewed. 

# Tests

This will be detailed at a later date.
